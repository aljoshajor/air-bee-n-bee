    <p class="card-text">Did you know that bees perform waggle dances in order to communicate with one another? Or that bees have a sense of smell 50 times more powerful than a dogâ€™s? But hold your horses, there is more! Bees can build honeycombs in zero gravity and can be trained to located buried land mines!
These amazing little buggers are not only full of surprises but also tantamount to our food supply; one third of the food we consume is the result bee pollination, and the practice of beekeeping dates back at least 4,500 years (in Greek mythology, Apollo is credited as the first beekeeper ever). Without a doubt, bees are THE coolest tiny beings, and we think all of us should get to know them a little better. Check out our bees below and book your furry friend ASAP!</p>
